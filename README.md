Group wiki for Namazhvar's Thuruvimozhi.

The goal of this wiki is to:

1. Collate information about Thiruvaimozhi, to start with.
2. Link paasurams to the padis in commentaries.
3. Have both sanskrit & tamil text which can be searched in English, Tamil or Sanskrit.

Similar sites which provide these information but what they lack is listed below:

1. [sreevaishnavam.wordpress.com](https://sreevaishnavam.wordpress.com/ebooks/) - has link to [bhagavadvishayam](http://bhagavadvishayam.wordpress.com/) which has content on notes about commentaries, similar to what we are trying to do, but no recent entries and incomplete.
2. [divyaprabandham.org](http://www.divyaprabandham.org) - does not have search
3. [divyaprabandham.com](http://www.divyaprabandham.com) - not much content, looks more commercial !!
