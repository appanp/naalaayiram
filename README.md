Group wiki for Namazhvar's Thuruvimozhi.

The goal of this wiki is to:

1. Collate information about Thiruvaimozhi, to start with.
2. Link paasurams to the padis of commentaries.

Similar sites which provide these information but what they lack is listed below:

1. [divyaprabandham.org](http://www.divyaprabandham.org) - does not have search
2. [dravidaveda.org](http://dravidaveda.org) - has a search box but not searching tamil text or paasurams
3. [indiadivine.org](http://www.indiadivine.org/content/topic/1297241-4000-divya-prabandham-in-tamilpdf-format/) - more like Q&A forum. Has search & it works on forum posts. No tamil fonts.
4. [4000divyaprabandam blogspot](http://4000divyaprabandam.blogspot.in) - has the verses but [not all of them](http://thiruvaymozhi-9th-10thdecad.blogspot.ae). Text is only in English and recitation marks are not there.
5. [srivaishnavam.com](http://www.srivaishnavam.com/prabandham.htm) - has verses in Tamil text in PDF form, but no text search.
6. [namperumal.com](http://www.namperumal.com/divya-prabhandam.html) - has [Eedu text of Mudhal Paththu in Tamil as PDF](http://www.namperumal.com/downloads/tvm-1.pdf)
7. [ramanuja.org](http://www.ramanuja.org/sv/prabandham/) - has text in Emglish, but no search.
8. [prapatti.com](http://www.prapatti.com/slokas/category/tam-divyaprabandham.html) - mostly audio recordings of recitals.
